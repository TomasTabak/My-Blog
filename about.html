<p> Hi! My name is Tomas. I am in my early 20's and I'm just trying to figure it all out like the we all are. </p>

<p>This blog will be dedicated to sharing interesting and relevant bits of information I encounter on my journey in a way that is easy to read and easy to retain. My ultimate goal is to help people gain knowledge and different perspectives that in turn helps them on their individual journey. </p>

<p>My interests vary wildly; from marketing to mindfullness, psychology to piano, dinosaurs to Darwin, in my quest to be as open to as many different experiences and knowledges as possible, I am constantly discovering new interests and I look forward to writing about them as they come along. </p>
